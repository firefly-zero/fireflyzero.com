faq:
  - q: How much will it cost?

    a: >
      It mostly depends on the production costs. It won't be expensive,
      we're not trying to reinvent a smartphone. But it won't be as cheap
      as countless chinese GBA clones. In any case, we'll make sure that
      it's free considering the included games. For example, if device costs $100
      and an average retro game costs $5, we'll make sure to provide at least 20
      free high-quality games.
  - q: What happens to my game if your startup fails?
    icon: fa-solid fa-bomb
    a: >
      As one of our first steps, we plan a web emulator. And we already have
      a desktop emulator. Even if the physical device will never come to life,
      your game will still be playable online.
  - q: How to follow the progress?
    icon: fa-solid fa-user-plus
    a: >
      We're researching the best ways and platforms to stay in touch with the early adopters.
      Meanwhile, [follow me on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@orsinium),
      I'll post announcements there.
  - q: What's the current status?
    icon: fa-solid fa-hourglass-start
    a: >
      We have an emulator working, and hardware in development. We also have published
      [gamgee](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/gamgee),
      a proof of concept that runs WASM-4 games on PyBadge. It works great.
  - q: When can I buy it?
    icon: fa-solid fa-calendar-days
    a: >
      We go with the flow. We focus on delivering the best product rather than
      delivering anything but fast. We'll make sure to provide a way to donate
      money for the cause. And when we have the prototype perfected,
      we plan launching a kickstarter campaign to raise money for the production.
  - q: How can I help?
    icon: fa-solid fa-handshake-angle
    a: >
      The most valuable help we can get is people who'll make
      games for the console and provide us feedback on all strugles they have.
      We want to perfect the development tooling and experience.
      But we need to settle some moving parts first.
  - q: Will it be open-source?
    icon: fa-brands fa-github
    a: >
      Yes! Both software and hardware will be free and open-source.
      Our main profit will be from selling physical units.
